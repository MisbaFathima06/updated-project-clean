## Overview

SpeakSecure is a privacy-first anonymous complaint platform designed to help vulnerable populations report sensitive issues like harassment, abuse, discrimination, and corruption without fear of retaliation. The platform serves victims in various environments including corporates, schools, hostels, homes, and public spaces. Using Zero-Knowledge cryptography and blockchain technology, SpeakSecure ensures complete anonymity while providing verifiable proof of complaint authenticity. The system supports multiple user roles including anonymous complainants, NGO partners for case management, and administrators for platform oversight.
