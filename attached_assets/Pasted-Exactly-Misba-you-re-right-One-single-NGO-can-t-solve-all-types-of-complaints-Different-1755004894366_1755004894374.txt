Exactly, Misba â€” youâ€™re right.
**One single NGO** canâ€™t solve *all* types of complaints.
Different problems need **different trusted authorities**.

Hereâ€™s how it usually works in real systems like ours:

| **Type of Complaint**                   | **Who Should Handle It (in reality)**                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sexual assault / rape**               | Police (womenâ€™s cell, cybercrime cell), NGOs that help survivors               |
| **Workplace harassment**                | Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in that company + HR, or Labour Commission |
| **School/college bullying**             | School Principal, Anti-bullying committee, Education Dept                      |
| **Domestic abuse**                      | Police, Womenâ€™s helpline (181), local NGOs                                     |
| **Cyber harassment / threats**          | Cybercrime police, helplines                                                   |
| **Public safety (e.g., unsafe street)** | Municipal corporation, local police                                            |
| **Discrimination (religion/caste)**     | Human Rights Commission, Social Justice Dept                                   |

ðŸ”¹ In **SpeakSecureâ€™s future version**, we can:

* Ask the victim **"Who should receive this?"** during complaint submission.
* Route it **only to that authorityâ€™s secure dashboard**.
* Each authority (Police, NGO, HR, School, etc.) will have **their own encryption key** â€” so they can only see the complaints meant for them.

This way, a rape case wonâ€™t end up in a school principalâ€™s dashboard, and a workplace issue wonâ€™t go to the police unless the victim wants.

If you want, I can make you **a ready list of authorities for each complaint category** so we can code routing into the backend later. That will make it 100% real-world.
